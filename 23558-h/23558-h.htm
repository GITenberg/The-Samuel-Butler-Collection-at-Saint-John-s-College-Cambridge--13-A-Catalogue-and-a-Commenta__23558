it, that the true life of anyone is not the one they live in
themselves, and of which they are themselves conscious, but the
life they live in the hearts of others.&nbsp; Our bodies and
brains are but the tools with which we work to make our true
life, which is not in the tool-box and tools we ignorantly
mistake for ourselves, but in the work we do with them; and this
work, if it be truly done, lives more in others than in
ourselves.</p>

v</span>Preface</h2>
<p>The Butler Collection was not all given to St. John&rsquo;s at
once.&nbsp; I sent up some pictures and some books in 1917; and
at intervals I have sent more, always keeping a list of what has
gone.&nbsp; Now that I have no more to send seems the proper time
for a Catalogue to be issued, and it is made from the lists which
I kept, and which were in part printed in <i>The Eagle</i>, put
in order by A. T. Bartholomew and annotated by myself.&nbsp; I am
responsible for the notes and am the person intended when
&ldquo;I&rdquo; and &ldquo;me&rdquo; occur.&nbsp; Bartholomew is
responsible for the classification, for verifying, for checking,
and for the bibliographical part.</p>
<p>In time the collection will no doubt increase as new editions
or translations of Butler&rsquo;s books appear and as further
books are published referring to him.&nbsp; All such I intend to
include in the collection; and I hope that other Butlerians will
see fit to make additions to it.</p>
<p>I think that the notes give all necessary explanations; but I
may perhaps say here that many of the pictures were made before
Butler contemplated writing such a book as <i>Alps and
Sanctuaries</i>.&nbsp; When he was preparing that book he went to
the places therein described and made on the spot many black and
white drawings for reproduction; but he found that this method
would take too long, so he made others of the black and white
drawings from oil and water-colour sketches which he had done
previously, and this is why some of the pictures are dated many
years before the book was published.</p>
<p>Among the books, under <i>Alps and Sanctuaries</i> (p. 18), is
Streatfeild&rsquo;s copy of that work; and under <i>The Way of
All Flesh</i> (p. 21) is his copy of that book.&nbsp; Both these
copies are said to have been &ldquo;purchased.&rdquo;&nbsp; I
bought them from the dealer to whom Streatfeild sold them when
his health broke down and he moved from his rooms.&nbsp; I have
no doubt that he would have given them to me if I had asked for
them, but he was not in a condition to be troubled about
business.</p>

towards the expenses of printing and publishing this
catalogue.&nbsp; I offer them my most cordial thanks for their
generosity.&nbsp; I am also deeply indebted to them for finding
space in which to house the collection.&nbsp; I shrank from the
responsibility of keeping it myself.&nbsp; I remembered also that
an individual dies; even a family may become extinct; but St.
John&rsquo;s College, we hope, will enjoy as near an approach to
immortality as can be attained on this transient globe.&nbsp; I
am sure that Butler would be pleased if he could know that during
that period this collection will be preserved and will be
accessible to all who wish to visit it.</p>

<p>FACSIMILE OF POST-CARD FROM S. BUTLER TO H. F. JONES,
FLORENCE, SEPT. 3, 1892 . . . <i>face p.</i> 23</p>
<p class="gutbutlercomment">Butler was staying in Florence on his
way home from his first visit to Sicily.&nbsp; The old Greek
painting referred to is reproduced as the frontispiece to <i>The
Authoress of the Odyssey</i> (1897).&nbsp; Mlle. V. is Mlle.
Vaillant, as to whom see <i>the Memoir</i>.&nbsp; The
&ldquo;nose&rdquo; belonged to the editor of a Swiss paper whom I
had met at Fusio.</p>

1858 . . . <i>face p.</i> 52</p>

<h2><!-- page 1--><a name="page1"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
1</span>I.&nbsp; PICTURES, SKETCHES AND DRAWINGS<br />
BY OR RELATING TO SAMUEL BUTLER</h2>
<p>By his will Butler bequeathed his pictures, sketches, and
studies to his executors to be destroyed or otherwise disposed of
as they might think best, the proceeds (if any) to fall into
residue.&nbsp; They were not sold: some were given to Shrewsbury
School; some to the British Museum; one, an unfinished sketch of
the back of the house in which Keats died on the Piazza di
Spagna, Rome, to the Keats and Shelley Memorial there; many were
distributed among his friends, Alfred Cathie taking fifteen and I
taking all that were left over.&nbsp; Alfred lives in Canal Road,
Mile End, and, this being on the route of the German air-raids,
he was anxious to put his pictures in a place of safety.&nbsp;
Accordingly it was arranged between us in 1917 that I should buy
them from him.&nbsp; When he heard that I was giving them to St.
John&rsquo;s, he desired that I should not buy all, because he
wished to give two of them himself to the College.&nbsp;
Accordingly, I bought only thirteen, and the remaining two, viz.
no. 28, Leatherhead Church, and no. 59, Chiavenna, 1887, were
given to St. John&rsquo;s College by Alfred.</p>
<p>There are but few sketches or pictures by Butler between 1888
and 1896.&nbsp; This is because his sketching was interrupted by
his having to take up photography for the preparation of <i>Ex
Voto</i>.&nbsp; Almost before this book was published (1888) he
had plunged into <i>The Life and Letters of Dr. Butler</i>, and
in 1892 he added to his absorbing occupations the problem of the
<i>Odyssey</i>.&nbsp; Thus he had little leisure or energy for
the labour of painting; and this labour was always great.&nbsp;
He could not leave his outline until he had got it right, and
there was a perpetual chase after the changing shadows.&nbsp; And
when he had got the outline it was so constantly disappearing
under the colour that he took to making &ldquo;a careful outline
on a separate sheet of paper&rdquo;; this was to be kept, after
he had traced the drawing on to the paper which was to receive
the colour, and to be referred to continually while he
proceeded.&nbsp; When he met <!-- page 2--><a
name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>with the camera
lucida, which he bought in Paris, and which is among the objects
given to St. John&rsquo;s, he thought his difficulties were
solved and wrote to Miss Savage, 9 October, 1882: &ldquo;I have
got a new toy, a camera lucida, which does all the drawing for
me, and am so pleased with it that I am wanting to use it
continually.&rdquo;&nbsp; To which in 1901 he added this note:
&ldquo;What a lot of time I wasted over that camera lucida, to be
sure!&rdquo;&nbsp; It did all the drawing for him, but it
distorted the perspective so that the outlines of the many
sketches which he produced with its help were a
disappointment.</p>
<p>The camera lucida having failed, his hopes were next fixed
upon photography, which, by rapidly and correctly recording
anything he felt a desire to sketch, was to give him something
from which he could afterwards construct a picture.&nbsp; So he
took an immense number of snap-shots, of which many are at St.
John&rsquo;s, but he never did anything with them.&nbsp; Nos. 62
and 63, which were done by Sadler from Butler&rsquo;s
photographs, show how he would have proceeded if he had not had
too many other things to do.</p>
<p>It was not until 1896, when <i>The Life of Dr. Butler</i>
appeared, that he was able to return seriously to sketching, and
by that time he was over sixty and too old to be burdened with
the paraphernalia necessary for oils; he therefore confined
himself to water-colours.</p>
<p>Some of the pictures in this list were included in the list in
<i>The Eagle</i>, vol. xxxix., no. 175, March 1918, and the
remainder in the succeeding number, June 1918.&nbsp; In making
the present catalogue I have corrected such errors and misprints
as I noticed in <i>The Eagle</i>, and I have re-arranged and
renumbered the items so as to make them run in chronological
order.&nbsp; I have also amplified some of the notes.&nbsp; I
have placed the sketches and drawings in order of date because to
examine them in that order helps the spectator to realise the
progress made by Butler in his artistic studies.</p>
<h3>SAMUEL BUTLER</h3>
<p>1.&nbsp; Black and white outline sketch: Civita Vecchia,
1854.</p>
<p class="gutbutlercomment">Butler went abroad with his family,
his second visit to Italy, for the winter of 1853-4.&nbsp; They
travelled through Switzerland to Rome and Naples, starting in
August 1853, and Butler thus missed the half-year at
school.&nbsp; I am sorry that I have not found any more finished
drawing made by him on this occasion.</p>
<h3><!-- page 3--><a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
3</span>DOUGLAS YEOMAN BLAKISTON</h3>
<p>2.&nbsp; Pencil drawing: Samuel Butler, 1854.</p>
<p class="gutbutlercomment">Reproduced in the <i>Memoir</i>, ch.
iii.&nbsp; On the back of this drawing is the beginning of a
water-colour sketch.&nbsp; It was in a book with others mentioned
in the <i>Memoir</i> as having been given to Shrewsbury School
(I. 44).&nbsp; I have no doubt that the sketch on the back is by
Butler, and represents part of the Rectory house at Langar.</p>
<p class="gutbutlercomment">The Rev. D. Y. Blakiston was born in
1832.&nbsp; He studied art at the Royal Academy Schools
especially under W. Dobson, R.A.&nbsp; From about 1850 to 1865 he
painted in London and at St. Leonard&rsquo;s, and exhibited at
the Royal Academy.&nbsp; About 1865 he entered at Downing
College, took Orders in 1869, and was presented to the living of
East Grinstead in 1871, which he held till his retirement soon
after 1908.&nbsp; He died in 1914.&nbsp; Throughout his life he
made a practise of sketching his friends.&nbsp; I suppose he must
have met and sketched Butler on some occasion when Butler was in
London staying with his cousins the Worsleys.&nbsp; The
artist&rsquo;s son, the Rev. H. E. D. Blakiston, when President
of Trinity College, Oxford, gave me a cutting from <i>The East
Grinstead Observer</i> containing a full obituary of him.&nbsp;
It is among the papers at St. John&rsquo;s College, and is
referred to in the Postscript to the Preface to my <i>Memoir</i>
of Butler.</p>
<h3>HENRY FESTING JONES</h3>
<p>3.&nbsp; My first attempt at a drawing in pencil and ink of
Butler&rsquo;s Homestead, Mesopotamia, New Zealand.</p>
<p class="gutbutlercomment">I did it in 1910 or thereabouts from
a faded photograph taken about 1863 and lent to Butler by J. D.
Enys.&nbsp; <i>Also</i> Emery Walker&rsquo;s reproduction of my
first attempt which was not used in the <i>Memoir</i>.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; My second attempt, which was reproduced in the
<i>Memoir</i>.</p>
<h3>SAMUEL BUTLER</h3>
<p>5.&nbsp; Water-colour: A view in Cambridge.</p>
<p class="gutbutlercomment">Probably done when Butler was an
undergraduate, and given to St. John&rsquo;s some years
ago.&nbsp; I found it in the book wherein I found
Blakiston&rsquo;s drawing (no. 2).</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; Oil Painting: Family Prayers.</p>
<p class="gutbutlercomment">On the ceiling he wrote &ldquo;I did
this in 1864, and if I had gone on doing things out of my own
head instead of making studies I should have been all
right.&rdquo;&nbsp; (<i>Memoir</i>, I. 115.)&nbsp; Reproduced in
the <i>Memoir</i>, ch. xxiv., and referred to, ch. viii.</p>
<p><!-- page 4--><a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
4</span>7.&nbsp; Oil Painting: His own head.</p>
<p class="gutbutlercomment">&ldquo;He painted at home as well as
at Heatherley&rsquo;s, and by way of a cheap model hung up a
looking-glass near the window of his painting room and made many
studies of his own head.&nbsp; He gave some of them away and
destroyed and painted over others, but after his death we found a
number in his rooms&mdash;some of the earlier ones very
curious&rdquo; (<i>Memoir</i>, ch. viii.).&nbsp; This is one of
the earlier ones.&nbsp; It is inscribed, &ldquo;S.B., Feb. 18,
1865.&rdquo;&nbsp; We found also a still more curious one which
was given to Gogin, who was interested in it as being the work of
an untaught student.&nbsp; See also no. 36.</p>
<h3>JOHN LEECH</h3>
<p>8.&nbsp; Five pencil drawings on one card.</p>
<p class="gutbutlercomment">John Leech died in 1864, the year in
which Butler returned from New Zealand.&nbsp; There was a sale of
his drawings by his sisters, and I remember going to see them as
a boy, but I do not remember when; it was, no doubt, soon after
the artist&rsquo;s death.&nbsp; The house was in Radnor Place,
Bayswater.&nbsp; His sisters afterwards kept a small girls&rsquo;
school, and my sister Lilian went there.&nbsp; I have placed
these Leech drawings here in order of date on the assumption that
Butler bought them at the sale.&nbsp; He had another drawing by
Leech, which used to hang in his chambers, and was given to his
cousin, Reginald Worsley.</p>
<h3>SAMUEL BUTLER</h3>
<p>9.&nbsp; Oil Painting: Interior of Butler&rsquo;s
sitting-room, 15, Clifford&rsquo;s Inn.</p>
<p class="gutbutlercomment">There is something written in pencil
on the panelling in the left-hand bottom corner.&nbsp; I believe
the words to be &ldquo;Corner of my room, Augt. 1865,
S.B.&rdquo;&nbsp; Reproduced in the <i>Memoir</i>, ch. xv.</p>
<p class="gutbutlercomment">Here are shown Butler&rsquo;s books,
including Bradshaw&rsquo;s Guide and Whitaker&rsquo;s Almanack,
of which he speaks somewhere as being indispensable.&nbsp; I
admit that I cannot identify them, but he used to keep them among
the books in these shelves.&nbsp; I do not think he ever
possessed that equally indispensable book the Post Office
Directory.&nbsp; But he had more books than those shown in this
painting.&nbsp; Between his sitting-room and his painting-room
was a short passage in which was a cupboard, and this contained
the rest.&nbsp; I do not remember how many there were, but not
enough to invalidate the statement he made to Robert Bridges
(<i>Memoir</i> II. 320), &ldquo;I have, I verily believe, the
smallest library of any man in London who is by way of being
literary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>10.&nbsp; Water-colour: Dieppe, The Castle, 1866.</p>
<p class="gutbutlercomment">Butler was at Dieppe with Pauli in
1866.&nbsp; (<i>Memoir</i>, ch. viii.)</p>
<p><!-- page 5--><a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
5</span>11.&nbsp; Small water-colour drawing: Dieppe, 1866.</p>
<p class="gutbutlercomment">This is in the portfolio of
miscellaneous drawings, etc., by Butler, Gogin, and Sadler, no.
81.</p>
<p>12.&nbsp; Oil Painting: Two heads done as a study at
Heatherley&rsquo;s.</p>
<p class="gutbutlercomment">I showed this to Gaetano Meo, and he
remembered that the man was Calorossi, a model, whose brother
went to Paris and became known as the proprietor of a studio
there.&nbsp; The woman, he said, was Maria, another model.&nbsp;
The background is Dieppe.&nbsp; I suppose that Butler did this
study in the autumn of 1866, using nos. 10 and 11, the
water-colours of Dieppe, or some other sketch made on the spot,
for the background.&nbsp; The idea was to make portraits of two
heads with a landscape background in the manner of Giovanni
Bellini.</p>
<p>13.&nbsp; Drawing of a cast of the Antinous as Hermes.</p>
<p class="gutbutlercomment">Inscribed &ldquo;Samuel Butler for
probationership, December 28th 1868.&rdquo;&nbsp; Done, I
suppose, at South Kensington.</p>
<p>14.&nbsp; Drawing of a hand and foot.</p>
<p class="gutbutlercomment">Probably also done at South
Kensington.</p>
<p>15.&nbsp; Black and white drawing of a fir tree.</p>
<p class="gutbutlercomment">This, I suspect, was made while
Butler was under the influence of Ruskin&rsquo;s <i>Elements of
Drawing</i>&mdash;say about 1870.&nbsp; He threw off that
influence later.</p>
<p>16.&nbsp; Four water-colour notes in one frame.</p>
<p class="gutbutlercomment">One is inscribed &ldquo;S.B.&rdquo;
and another &ldquo;Kingston, near Lewes.&rdquo;&nbsp; I suppose
that they are all on the South Downs, and they are all
early&mdash;say 1870.</p>
<h3>JAMES FERGUSON</h3>
<p>17.&nbsp; Crayon drawing: Butler playing Handel, 1870 (?).</p>
<p class="gutbutlercomment">Reproduced in the <i>Memoir</i> (I.
ix.).&nbsp; Ferguson was a fellow art-student with Butler.</p>
<h3>SAMUEL BUTLER</h3>
<p>18.&nbsp; Oil Painting: The Valle di Sambucco, above
Fusio.</p>
<p class="gutbutlercomment">The sambucco or sambuco is the elder
tree.&nbsp; Butler, writing of this valley (<i>Alps and
Sanctuaries</i>, ch. xxvi.; new ed. ch. xxv.), says: &ldquo;Here,
even in summer, the evening air will be crisp, and the dew will
form as soon as the sun goes off; but the mountains at one end of
it will keep the last rays of the sun.&nbsp; It is then the
valley is at its best, especially if the goats and cattle are
coming together to be milked.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 6--><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
6</span>19.&nbsp; Water-colour: The Rocca Borromeo, Angera, Lago
Maggiore.&nbsp; Entrance to the Castle.&nbsp; 1871.</p>
<p class="gutbutlercomment">The birthplace of S. Carlo
Borromeo.&nbsp; It was over this gateway as well as over the
gateway of F&eacute;nis (no. 53), that he told me there ought to
be a fresco of Fortune with her Wheel (<i>Memoir</i>, ch.
xx.)&nbsp; The Rocca Borromeo, Angera, and Arona are mentioned in
<i>Alps and Sanctuaries</i>, ch. xxiv. (new edn., ch. xxiii.),
and several times in the <i>Memoir</i>, <i>e.g.</i> ch. ix.,
xvi.</p>
<p>20.&nbsp; Water-colour: The Rocca Borromeo.&nbsp; A Room in
the Castle.&nbsp; 1871.</p>
<p class="gutbutlercomment">I am not sure whether or not this is
the room in which S. Carlo Borromeo was born.&nbsp; One view of
that room is in <i>Alps and Sanctuaries</i> ch. xxiv. (new
edition, ch. xxiii).&nbsp; This may be the same room looking
towards the left and showing a piece of window-seat and
shutter.</p>
<p>21.&nbsp; Water-colour: Amsteg.&nbsp; 1871.</p>
<p>22.&nbsp; Water-colour: Fobello.&nbsp; A Christening.&nbsp;
1871.</p>
<p class="gutbutlercomment">This was to have been a picture for
the Academy, but he did not finish it.&nbsp; Here are shown women
with short skirts and leggings.&nbsp; They dress like this so
that they can climb into the ash trees and pull off the leaves
which they throw down upon the grass to be mixed up with the
hay.&nbsp; (<i>Memoir</i>, ch. ix.)</p>
<p>23.&nbsp; Oil Painting: Varallo-Sesia.&nbsp; The Washing
Place.&nbsp; 1871.</p>
<p class="gutbutlercomment">&ldquo;Butler made three oil sketches
at Varallo all the same size, about 16x20.&nbsp; One is the
washing place outside the town.&rdquo;&nbsp; (<i>Diary of a
Journey</i>, p. 16).&nbsp; The other two were both done in the
Piazza on the Sacro Monte.&nbsp; One was given to the Municipio
of Varallo-Sesia; the other to the Avvocato Francesco Negri of
Casale-Monferrato.</p>
<p>24.&nbsp; Oil Painting: Monte Bisbino, near Como.&nbsp;
1876.</p>
<p class="gutbutlercomment"><i>Alps and Sanctuaries</i>, ch.
xxi.&nbsp; The white sanctuary on the summit shines like a
diamond in some lights.</p>
<p>25.&nbsp; Oil Painting: From S. Nicolao, Mendrisio.&nbsp;
1876.</p>
<p class="gutbutlercomment"><i>Alps and Sanctuaries</i>, ch.
xxi.</p>
<h3>GEORGE McCULLOCH</h3>

<p>35.&nbsp; Oil Painting: Lago Tom, Piora, Val Leventina.&nbsp;
1877.</p>
<p class="gutbutlercomment">Ch. vi. in <i>Alps and
Sanctuaries</i> is headed &ldquo;Piora.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Piora
in fact is a fine breezy upland valley of singular beauty, and
with a sweet atmosphere of cow about it.&rdquo;&nbsp; Butler
thought he knew what went on in Piora and, as he proceeds through
the valley, he says: &ldquo;Here I heard that there were people,
and the people were not so much asleep as the simple peasantry of
these upland valleys are expected to be by nine o&rsquo;clock in
the evening.&nbsp; For now was the time when they had moved up
from Ronco, Altanca, and other villages in some numbers to cut
the hay, and were living for a fortnight or three weeks in the
chalets upon the Lago di Cadagna.&nbsp; As I have said, there is
a chapel, but I doubt whether it is attended during this season
with the regularity with which the parish churches of Ronco,
Altanca, etc., are attended during the rest of the year.&nbsp;
The young people, I am sure, like these annual visits to the high
places, and will be hardly weaned from them.&nbsp; Happily the
hay will always be there, and will have to be cut by someone, and
the old people will send the young ones.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="gutbutlercomment">The foregoing passage throws light
upon that other passage in <i>Life and Habit</i>, ch. ii., about
S. Paul, which concludes thus: &ldquo;But the true grace, with
her groves and high places, and troops of young men and maidens
crowned with flowers, and singing of love and youth and
wine&mdash;the true grace he drove out into the
wilderness&mdash;high up, <!-- page 8--><a name="page8"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 8</span>it may be, into Piora, and into
such-like places.&nbsp; Happy they who harboured her in her ill
report.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="gutbutlercomment">After Ernest has received
Alethea&rsquo;s money, and while he and Edward Overton are
returning from Christina&rsquo;s funeral, in ch. lxxxiv. of
<i>The Way of All Flesh</i>, he tells his godfather his plans for
spending the next year or two.&nbsp; He has formed a general
impression that the most vigorous and amiable of known
nations&mdash;the modern Italians, the old Greeks and Romans, and
the South Sea Islanders&mdash;have not been purists.&nbsp; He
wants to find out what such people do; they are the practical
authorities on the question&mdash;What is best for man?</p>
<p class="gutbutlercomment">&ldquo;Let us,&rdquo; he says,
&ldquo;settle the fact first and fight about the moral tendencies
afterwards.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="gutbutlercomment">&ldquo;In fact,&rdquo; said I
laughingly, &ldquo;you mean to have high old times.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="gutbutlercomment">&ldquo;Neither higher nor
lower,&rdquo; was the answer, &ldquo;than those people whom I can
find to have been the best in all ages.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="gutbutlercomment">Accordingly Ernest left England and
visited &ldquo;almost all parts of the world, but only staying in
those places where he found the inhabitants unusually
good-looking and agreeable.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;At last in the
spring of 1867 he returned, his luggage stained with the
variation of each hotel advertisement &rsquo;twixt here and
Japan.&nbsp; He looked very brown and strong, and so
well-favoured that it almost seemed as if he must have caught
some good looks from the people among whom he had been
staying.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="gutbutlercomment">We are not told what particular
countries Ernest went to; Japan is mentioned, but less because
Ernest went there than because the name of a distant place was
wanted to justify and complete the echo of the description of Sir
Walter Blunt in I. <i>Hen. IV.</i> i. 64:</p>
<blockquote><p>Stained with the variation of each soil<br />
Betwixt that Holmedon and this seat of ours.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="gutbutlercomment">Butler confided to me verbally that
Ernest visited, among other places, Piora, and that he stayed
there &ldquo;when the mowing grass was about.&rdquo; <a

<p class="gutbutlercomment">This is one of the series of
portraits of himself referred to in the note to no. 7.&nbsp;
Another of these later portraits was given after his death to
Christchurch, New Zealand; and another to the Schools,
Shrewsbury.&nbsp; This one was given by Butler to me soon after
it was painted, and it remained in my possession till 1911, when
I gave it to St. John&rsquo;s College.&nbsp; It is reproduced as

<p class="gutbutlercomment">&ldquo;I know few things more
touching in their way than the porch of Rossura
church.&rdquo;&nbsp; (<i>Alps and Sanctuaries</i>, ch. iv.)</p>
<p class="gutbutlercomment">&ldquo;The church is built on a
slope, and the porch, whose entrance is on a lower level than
that of the floor of the church, contains a flight of steps
leading up to the church door.&nbsp; The porch is there to
shelter the steps, on and around which the people congregate and
gossip before and after service, especially in bad weather.&nbsp;
They also sometimes overflow picturesquely, and kneel praying on
the steps while service is going on inside.&rdquo;&nbsp;
(<i>Memoir</i>, I. 284-5.)</p>
<p class="gutbutlercomment">In <i>Alps and Sanctuaries</i>, ch.
iv., is an illustration showing the people kneeling on the steps
while &ldquo;there came a sound of music through the open
door&mdash;the people lifting up their voices and singing, as
near as I can remember, something which on the piano would come
thus:&rdquo; and then follow a few bars of chords.</p>
<p class="gutbutlercomment">In the list which appeared in <i>The
Eagle</i>, vol. xxxix., no. 175, March 1918, writing of no. 38:
&ldquo;Rossura: the altar by the porch of the church,
1878,&rdquo; I said that it had been removed.&nbsp; On
reconsideration, I am not sure that it has been removed; but I
have not been to Rossura for thirty years or more and cannot now
say for certain.&nbsp; I believe, however, that it is still
there, and that when I said it had been removed I was thinking of
the alteration of an opening which there was formerly in the west
wall of the porch, under the portrait of S. Carlo Borromeo, which
hangs between the two windows.&nbsp; This opening is mentioned in
ch. iv. of <i>Alps and Sanctuaries</i>, and Butler says that it
had to be closed because the wind blew through it and made the
church too cold.&nbsp; It is shown with the portrait and the two
windows in another illustration in ch. iv.</p>
<p class="gutbutlercomment">The first illustration in ch. iv. of
<i>Alps and Sanctuaries</i> shows how the chapel with the altar
in it (no. 38) is placed in relation to the porch.&nbsp; This is
the chapel he was thinking of when he wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The church has been a good deal restored
during the last few years, and an interesting old
chapel&mdash;with an altar in it&mdash;at which Mass was said
during a time of plague, while the people stood some way off in a
meadow, has just been entirely renovated; but, as with <!-- page
10--><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>some
English churches, the more closely a piece of old work is copied,
the more palpably does the modern spirit show through it, so here
the opposite occurs, for the old-worldliness of the place has not
been impaired by much renovation, though the intention has been
to make everything as modern as possible.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="gutbutlercomment">In 1878, the first time I was with
Butler in Italy and in the Canton Ticino, he talked a great deal
about the porch of Rossura; there is a passage in ch. xvi. of the
<i>Memoir</i> about it.&nbsp; For him it was the work of a man
who did it because he sincerely wanted to do it, and who learnt
how to do by doing; it was not the work of one who first attended
lectures by a professor in an academy, learnt the usual tricks in
an art school, and then, not wanting to do, gloried in the
display of his technical skill.&nbsp; That is to say, it was done
in the right spirit.&nbsp; The result of doing things in this way
will sometimes appear incompetent; this never embarrassed Butler,
provided that he could detect the sincerity; for where sincerity
is incompetence may be forgiven; but the incompetence must not be
so great as to obscure the artist&rsquo;s meaning.&nbsp; At
Rossura the sincerity is obvious, and the building is so perfect
an adaptation of the means to the end that there is no suggestion
of incompetence.</p>
<p class="gutbutlercomment">Rossura porch was thus an
illustration of what he says in <i>Alps and Sanctuaries</i> in
the chapter &ldquo;Considerations on the Decline of Italian
Art.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was more than merely a piece of
architecture.&nbsp; When Butler contemplated it he saw also the
chapel with its altar and the people standing in the meadow
during the plague; he saw the same people, after the pestilence
had been stayed, kneeling on the steps in the dimness, the sky
bright through the arch beyond them and the distant mountains
blue and snowy, while the music floated out through the open
church door; he saw through the windows the gleaming slopes about
Cornone and Dalpe, and, hanging on the wall between them, the
picture of austere old S. Carlo with his hands joined in
prayer.&nbsp; All these things could be written about in <i>Alps
and Sanctuaries</i>, but they could not be brought into the
illustrations apart from the text; and anyone who looks at
Butler&rsquo;s sketches of Rossura may be disappointed.&nbsp; If
he does not bear these things in mind he will not understand what
Butler meant by saying that he knew of few things more touching
in their way than the porch of Rossura church.&nbsp; He will be
like a man listening to programme-music and knowing nothing of
the programme.</p>

which extracts are given below.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>Miss Savage to Butler</i>.</p>
<blockquote><p>31<i>st</i> <i>October</i>, 1883: I went to the
Fisheries Exhibition last week and spent a rather pleasant
day.&nbsp; I was by myself for one thing, and, for another, took
great delight in gazing at a life-size model of a sea-captain
clad in yellow oil-skins and a Sou&rsquo;wester.&nbsp; It was
executed in that style of art that you so greatly admire in the
Italian Churches, and was so good a likeness of <i>you</i> that I
think you must have sat for it.&nbsp; The serious occupations of
my day were having dinner and tea, and the relaxations, buying
shrimps in the fish-market and then giving them to the sea-gulls
and cormorants.&nbsp; My most exalted pleasure was to look at
your effigy, which I should like to be able to buy, though, as I
have not a private chapel in my castle, I hardly know where I
could put it if I had it.&nbsp; Upon the whole I enjoyed myself,
but I am glad to hear that the Exhibition is to be closed to-day,
so that I cannot by any possibility go there again.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>Butler to Miss Savage</i>.</p>
<blockquote><p>5<i>th</i> <i>November</i>, 1883: I believe I am
very like a sea-captain.&nbsp; Jones began a likeness of me not
long since, which I will show you next time you come and see me,
which is also very like a portrait of a sea-captain.</p>

<p>56.&nbsp; Sketch-portrait of Robert Doncaster.</p>
<p class="gutbutlercomment">On the same mount with no. 40.&nbsp;
A tracing is among the miscellaneous papers given to St.
John&rsquo;s.&nbsp; This sketch of Robert was done, I suspect,
with the camera lucida, and if so its date must be about
1882-3.&nbsp; Robert Doncaster was the husband of Mrs. Corrie;
that is to say Mrs. Corrie, who was Butler&rsquo;s laundress in
Clifford&rsquo;s Inn, &ldquo;lost&rdquo; her husband.&nbsp; After
a suitable interval it was assumed that he was dead and she
married Robert Doncaster and was known as Mrs. Doncaster.&nbsp;
Robert, who was a half-witted old man, used to hang about the
place, do odd jobs, and make himself fairly useful.&nbsp; He died
in 1886.</p>

J. Jones, Esq., of the Indian Geological Survey, Aet. Suae 24,
painted by S. Butler, November, 1883.&rdquo;&nbsp; The date is
not clearly written, but it must be 1883, because my brother
Edward, born 5th September, 1859, was twenty-four in 1883, and in
November 1883 he went to Calcutta, having obtained an appointment
on the Geological Survey.&nbsp; Butler painted the portrait just
before he started.</p>
<p>59.&nbsp; Oil Painting: Chiavenna.&nbsp; 1887.</p>
<p class="gutbutlercomment">It looks in some lights like 1881,
but in other lights 1887, and it must be 1887.&nbsp; Butler did
not go abroad in 1881 and he was at Chiavenna in 1887.&nbsp; This

<p class="gutbutlercomment">I forget the precise date, but I
think it was about 1898, when Butler was searching in real
landscape for the original of the castle which appears in the
background of one of the Giovanni Bellini pictures of the Madonna
and Child in the National Gallery, the one <!-- page 14--><a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>with the bird
on the tree and the man ploughing.&nbsp; It may now be attributed
to some other Venetian painter.&nbsp; He would have been pleased
if he could have found the original of the background of any
picture by one of his favourite painters.&nbsp; This copy was
made to fix in his mind the castle on the hill, which he hoped
afterwards to identify with some real place.&nbsp; But he never
succeeded.</p>

<p class="gutbutlercomment">In these rooms Butler nearly always
spent his evenings from 1893, when I moved into them, until the
end of his life.&nbsp; The frames of these pictures are veneered
with oak from the Hall of Staple Inn, and into each are inserted
two buttons showing the wool-pack, the badge of the Inn, which is
said to be named from the Wool-Staplers.</p>
<p class="gutbutlercomment">When Butler and I were on the
Rigi-Scheidegg with Hans Faesch in 1900 I had these two sketches
with me, and was showing them to the landlord, who spoke
English.&nbsp; He looked at them and considered them carefully
for some moments.&nbsp; Then he said gravely &ldquo;Ah I see;
much things.&nbsp; That means dustings; and then breakings; and
then hangriness.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>SAMUEL BUTLER</h3>

<p class="gutbutlercomment">We went often to Meien to sketch when
we were staying at Wassen on the S. Gottardo.&nbsp; We took our
lunch with us, and ate it at the fountain in the village.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The old priest also came to the fountain to wash his
shutters, which had been taken down for the summer, and it was
now time to bring them out again and replace them for the
winter&rdquo; (<i>Memoir</i>, II. 236).&nbsp; The house on the
left is the priest&rsquo;s house, and the shutters are already up
at one of his windows.</p>

situation of Trapani and the Islands with Marettimo &ldquo;all

FORMERLY THE PROPERTY OF OR RELATING TO SAMUEL BUTLER</h2>
<p>Thomas Harris, of Shrewsbury.</p>
<p class="gutbutlercomment">Butler when a boy was amused by the
advertisement put up over his shop by this man, who was a
baker.&nbsp; He copied or invented the two pictures showing
Harris (1) making bride cakes, (2) making funeral cakes, and
composed the music.&nbsp; Miss Butler showed it to me at
Shrewsbury in June or July, 1902, and I copied it.</p>
<p>MS. copies of &ldquo;The New Scriptures,&rdquo; according to
Darwin, Tyndall, Huxley and Spencer.</p>
<p class="gutbutlercomment">The first twenty-four verses of this
appeared in an American paper (the <i>Index</i>, if I remember
right) many years ago.&nbsp; They were given to me by Herbert
Phipson; I showed them to Butler; he copied them and composed
verses 25 to 33.</p>

Garnett, LL.D.; A. C. Gow, A.R.A.; T. Heatherley; the Rev. B. H.
Kennedy, D.D.; Henry Stacy Marks, R.A.; and W. T. Marriott, M.P.,
submitted by Butler in 1886 when a Candidate for the Slade
Professorship of Fine Art at Cambridge.</p>
<p>Two numbers of the Parish Magazine of St. Augustine&rsquo;s,
Kilburn, Mar. 1887 and April 1887.</p>
<p class="gutbutlercomment">Between pp. 80 and 81 of the March
number are unsuitable advertisements of Pears&rsquo; Soap
involving the Bishop Q of Wangaloo and Lillie Langtry.&nbsp;
Their appearance drew from the Editor, pp. 97 and 112 of the
April number, an expression of regret, distress, and surprise,
and a statement that precautions had been taken against any
occurrence of a similar nature in future.&nbsp; If I remember
right Miss Savage sent these to Butler and they are referred to
in their correspondence, but perhaps not in any of the letters
included in the <i>Memoir</i>.</p>
<p>Review of &ldquo;Luck or Cunning?&rdquo; written by George
Bernard Shaw, which appeared in the <i>Pall Mall Gazette</i>,
31st May, 1887.</p>
<p class="gutbutlercomment">This was given to me by Dan Rider,
who told me that Bernard Shaw&rsquo;s original review, which he
wrote off his own bat, was very much more laudatory and much
longer, but the Editor of the <i>Pall Mall Gazette</i> cut it
down in length and took out some of the praise because he was
afraid of offending the Darwins and their friends.</p>

54</span>XI.&nbsp; EFFECTS<br />
FORMERLY THE PERSONAL PROPERTY OF SAMUEL BUTLER</h2>
<p>One mahogany table with two flaps.</p>
<p class="gutbutlercomment">Butler used this table for his meals,
for his writing, and for all purposes to which a table can be
put.&nbsp; A corner of it covered with a red cloth is seen in the
picture of the interior of his room.&nbsp; See p. 4, no. 9.</p>
<p>Sandwich case.</p>
<p class="gutbutlercomment">This he took with him on his Sunday
walks and sketching excursions.</p>
<p>Passport.</p>
<p>Pocket magnifying glass.</p>
<p>Address book.</p>
<p>Homeopathic medicine case.</p>
<p class="gutbutlercomment">He always took this with him on his
travels.</p>
<p>Two account books, 1897-1900 and 1900-1902.</p>
<p class="gutbutlercomment">Butler destroyed his early account
books when he made the Skeleton Diary of his life which is in
Vol. III. of his MS. Note-Books.&nbsp; After his death the
remaining account books were destroyed except these two.</p>
<p>Books in which Butler used to keep his accounts by double
entry.&nbsp; The handwriting during the early years is
Butler&rsquo;s, afterwards it is Alfred&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Journal,
1895-1902; Cash Book, 1881-1899; Cash Book, 1899-1902; Union Bank
Book, 1881-1902; Ledger.</p>
<p>A set of books containing accounts for his published
works.</p>
<p>Two of the small note-books which after April 1882 Butler
always carried in his pocket and in which he made the notes
afterwards copied into his full-size MS. Note-Books.</p>
<p class="gutbutlercomment">Before 1882 he used some other kind
of pocket note-book.&nbsp; The first one he had of this kind was
sent to him by Miss Savage in a letter of 18th April, 1882, from
which the following is an extract; the words in square brackets
are a note by Butler on Miss Savage&rsquo;s letter.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I send you a little present; the leaves
tear out, so that when you leave your note-book at the
&ldquo;Food of Health&rdquo; [I don&rsquo;t remember ever <!--
page 55--><a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
55</span>going to the &ldquo;Food of Health.&rdquo;&nbsp; I do
not know the place.&nbsp; S. B.] or elsewhere, as you sometimes
have done, you will not lose so much, and then you can put the
torn leaves into one of the little drawers in your cabinet which
is just made for such documents.&rdquo;&nbsp; (<i>Memoir</i>, I.
373.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="gutbutlercomment">The cabinet she refers to was one of
the two Japanese cabinets, the next items, which he had bought at
Neighbour&rsquo;s grocery and tea-shop in Oxford Street, and
which she had seen in his rooms.&nbsp; He used to keep stamps in
them.</p>
<p>One small Japanese cabinet.</p>
<p>One larger Japanese cabinet.</p>
<p>Two pen trays.</p>
<p>One camera lucida with table (see the <i>Memoir</i>).</p>
<p>One round wood-carving: a female bust.</p>
<p>Two large dishes, German or Swiss, which stood on his
table.</p>
<p>One tin case holding pencils and brushes for water-colour
sketching.</p>
<p>One tin water-bottle for sketching.&nbsp; One sketching
camp-stool.&nbsp; One sketching portfolio.&nbsp; One water-colour
paint-box.</p>
<p>One sloping desk.</p>
<p class="gutbutlercomment">&ldquo;I shoud explain that I cannot
write unless I have a sloping desk.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; See
&ldquo;Quis desiderio&mdash;&rdquo; (<i>The Humour of
Homer</i>).&nbsp; This is the sloping desk on which he wrote in
Clifford&rsquo;s Inn.</p>
<p>One pair of chamois horns given him by Dionigi Negri at
Varallo Sesia.</p>
<p>One handle and webbing in which he carried his books to and
from the British Museum.</p>
<p>A photograph showing one wall of Butler&rsquo;s chambers in
Clifford&rsquo;s Inn with the fireplace and accompanying sketch
plan.</p>
<p class="gutbutlercomment">Some of the pictures mentioned in
Section I. of this Catalogue can be identified, and also the
following nine items, which are on the mantelpiece or on the
wall.&nbsp; The two dolls (no. 9) were destroyed by Butler about
1898; the other eight objects are included in this collection at
St. John&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>One pair of pewter candlesticks (1).</p>
<p><!-- page 56--><a name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
56</span>One bust of Handel (2).</p>
<p>One plate, which he called &ldquo;Three Acres and a
Cow,&rdquo; because it seems to be decorated in illustration of
that catch-word (3).</p>
<p>Two crockery holy water holders; only one is shown in the
photograph (4).</p>
<p>Three medallions under glass, representing, in some kind of
plaster, the Madonna di Oropa (5).</p>
<p>Three crockery examples of &ldquo;the Virgin with Child&rdquo;
(6).</p>
<p class="gutbutlercomment">One only is shown in the photo.&nbsp;
One of these is from Oropa where the Virgin and Child are both
black, see &ldquo;A Medieval Girl-School&rdquo; in <i>The Humour
of Homer</i>.&nbsp; These holy water holders and Madonnas are
some of the cheap religious knick-knacks which are sold at most
Italian Sanctuaries.&nbsp; We often brought back a few and gave
them away to Gogin, Alfred, Clark, and other friends.</p>
<p>Bag for pennies (7).</p>
<p>Miss Savage&rsquo;s kettle-holder (8).</p>
<p class="gutbutlercomment">In Oct. 1884 (see the <i>Memoir</i>),
about four months before her death, Miss Savage sent Butler a
present of a pair of socks which she had knitted herself, and she
promised to make him some more.&nbsp; Butler gratefully accepted
her gift, but</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;As for doing me any more, I flatly forbid
it.&nbsp; I believe you don&rsquo;t like my books, and want to
make me say I won&rsquo;t give you any more if you make me any
more socks; and then you will make me some more in order not to
get the books.&nbsp; No, I will let you read my stupid books in
manuscript and help me that way.&nbsp; If you like to make me a
kettle-holder, you may, for I only have one just now, and I like
to have two because I always mislay one; but I won&rsquo;t have
people working their fingers out to knit me stockings.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="gutbutlercomment"><i>Miss Savage to Butler</i>,
27<i>th</i> <i>Oct.</i> 1884: &ldquo;Here is a
kettle-holder.&nbsp; And I can only say that a man who is equal
to the control of two kettle-holders fills me with awe, and I
shall begin to be afraid of you. . . .&nbsp; The kettle-holder is
very clumsy and ugly, but please to remember that I am not a
many-sided genius, and to expect me to excel in kettle-holders
<i>and</i> stockings is unreasonable.&nbsp; I take credit to
myself, however, for affixing a fetter to it, so that you may
chain it up if it is too much disposed to wander.&nbsp; My
expectation is that it is too thick for you to grasp the kettle
with, and the kettle will slip out of your hand and scald you
frightfully.&nbsp; I shall be sorry for you but you would have
it, so upon your own head be it.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="gutbutlercomment"><i>Butler to Miss Savage</i>,
28<i>th</i> <i>Oct.</i> 1884: &ldquo;The kettle-holder is
beautiful; it is like a filleted sole, and I am very fond of
filleted sole.&nbsp; It is not at all too thick, and fits my
kettle to perfection.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="gutbutlercomment"><!-- page 57--><a
name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>The subject
is developed antiphonally between Miss Savage and Butler
throughout several letters, and near the close comes this note
made by Butler when &ldquo;editing his remains&rdquo; at the end
of his life:</p>
<p class="gutbutlercomment">&ldquo;I need hardly say that the
kettle-holder hangs by its fetter on the wall beside my fire, and
is not allowed to be used by anyone but myself.&nbsp; S.B.&nbsp;
January 21st, 1902.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two small Dutch dolls (9)</p>
<p class="gutbutlercomment">Mr. Charles Archer Cook was at
Trinity Hall with me.&nbsp; He is mentioned in the <i>Memoir</i>
as having edited <i>The Athen&aelig;um</i> in October, 1885,
during the absence of MacColl, the editor.&nbsp; Butler and I
sometimes dined with him and met his brother, Mr. (afterwards
Sir) Edward T. Cook and his wife.&nbsp; Mr. and Mrs. E. T. Cook
came to tea with Butler, and Alfred was showing them round the
sitting room, while Butler was in his painting room, where he had
gone to look for something.</p>
<p class="gutbutlercomment">&ldquo;These are the pictures which
the governor does when he is away,&rdquo; said Alfred, &ldquo;and
these are the photographs which he brings back with him and the
plates and images.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="gutbutlercomment">&ldquo;And please, Alfred, what are
these two little dolls among the pictures?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="gutbutlercomment">&ldquo;Oh, those, ma&rsquo;am!&nbsp;
Those are ---.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="gutbutlercomment">&ldquo;Alfred!&rdquo; exclaimed the
reproving voice of Butler, who although in the next room, had
overheard.</p>
<p class="gutbutlercomment">&ldquo;Well, Sir,&rdquo; replied
Alfred, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s what we always call them.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="gutbutlercomment">Alfred was referring to a recent
divorce case in which the names of two ladies had been brought
prominently before the public, but Butler did not approve of the
names being blurted out in the presence of visitors.</p>
<p>A brass bowl which my brother Edward brought from India.</p>
<p class="gutbutlercomment">It always stood on my table in Staple
Inn, and Butler used it as an ash-tray and played with it and
liked the sound it made when he struck it.&nbsp; He also liked
its shape, and was pleased with it for not being &ldquo;spoilt by
any silly ornament.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is mentioned in the
<i>Memoir</i> (II. xliii.) when Miss Butler comes to my rooms
after Butler&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>A leather (or sham leather) cigarette case from Palermo (but,
I am afraid, made in Germany).</p>
<p class="gutbutlercomment">It contains a fragment of a Greek
vase picked up on Mount Eryx and given to Butler by Bruno
Flury.&nbsp; He was one of the young men who came about him in
1892 when he broke his foot on the mountain; he afterwards
settled in Pisa, where I saw him in 1901.</p>
<p>Two of the blue and white wine cups mentioned in <i>Alps and
Sanctuaries</i> (ch. xxii.; new ed., ch. xxiii.), &ldquo;A Day at
the Cantine.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="gutbutlercomment">&ldquo;These little cups are common
crockery, but at the bottom there is written Viva Bacco, Viva
l&rsquo;Italia, Viva la Gioia, Viva Venere or other <!-- page
58--><a name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>such
matter; they are to be had in every crockery shop throughout the
Mendrisiotto, and they are very pretty.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="gutbutlercomment">The Viva is not written in full; it
is represented by a double V, which overlaps, so that it looks
like W, but the letter W is not used by the Italians, so there is
no chance of its being mistaken by them for anything but the
symbol meaning Viva.</p>
<p>A small horn and tortoiseshell snuff-box from Palermo.</p>
<p class="gutbutlercomment">It contains three coins wrapped in
paper and a piece of the pilgrim&rsquo;s cross at
Varello-Sesia.&nbsp; The cross is mentioned somewhere in
Butler&rsquo;s books as being of very hard wood, so hard that the
pilgrims have great difficulty in cutting pieces off it.&nbsp; So
had I in cutting off this bit.</p>
<p class="gutbutlercomment">The day after Butler&rsquo;s death
Alfred came to me with the coins and said:</p>
<p class="gutbutlercomment">&ldquo;I took these out of his
pockets, Sir; I thought you ought to have them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Butler&rsquo;s watch and chain.</p>
<p class="gutbutlercomment">Butler used to possess his
grandfather&rsquo;s gold watch and chain.&nbsp; He was robbed of
the watch in Hyde Park one night just before starting on one of
his journeys to Canada; he then bought this silver watch at
Benson&rsquo;s, and, if I remember right, wore it with the gold
chain.&nbsp; He was robbed of the chain in Fetter Lane, Oct. 1893
(<i>Memoir</i>, II. 167).&nbsp; He then bought a silver chain,
which, with the silver watch, passed under his will to
Alfred.&nbsp; Alfred wore them until 1919, when the watch was
declared by an expert to be beyond repair.&nbsp; I took it from
him, giving him in exchange the watch of my brother Charlie, who
had recently died.</p>
<p>The matchbox which Alfred gave to Butler.</p>
<p class="gutbutlercomment">When Alfred knew that I was handing
Butler&rsquo;s watch and chain on to St. John&rsquo;s College, he
said:</p>
<p class="gutbutlercomment">&ldquo;And then, Sir, they had better
have this matchbox which I gave him.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="gutbutlercomment">I looked at it and said, &ldquo;Well,
but Alfred, how can that be?&nbsp; It is dated 1894, and he gave
your matchbox to the Turk in 1895.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="gutbutlercomment">&ldquo;I know he did, Sir; and when
he told me I was very angry and went out into Holborn and bought
this one and had it engraved same as the other.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="gutbutlercomment">&ldquo;With the old date?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="gutbutlercomment">&ldquo;Yes, Sir, just the same as the
one he gave to the Turk.&rdquo;&nbsp; See the <i>Note-Books</i>,
p. 286.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://www.gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
